            <img src="images/jeremyHeadshot.jpg" height = "200" width = "200"alt="Picture of Jeremy Bakker">
              <p>I am a software developer drawn to the efficient interpretation of complex data sets. For over a decade, I studied and worked in the highest echelons of the academic world, honing my critical thinking skills among some of the world's best thinkers. All the while, I never forgot my roots. I was a latchkey kid as early as six years old and spent years working among youth involved in inner-city street gangs.</p>
              <p>Software development is, in many ways, my true home. I began programming at five years old and was smitten. But I was led to believe that I could better reach my potential through other pursuits. After completing my PhD and working alongside several technology entrepreneurs in Nashville to revitalize a historic non-profit organization, I came to realize that my skills are indeed better suited for software development. I am a learner, a leader, a creator, and a collaborator with an unparalleled ability to digest a large amount of complicated information quickly and to communicate it concisely. Having worked for years in international organizations committed to abstract ideals, I am ready to make a tangible contribution to my local community.</p>
              <p>Here you will find some of the ideas and organizations that have shaped me. Take a look at my <a href="influences.html" style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline">influences</a> and trace my recent path. See my <a href="cv.html" style="display: inline; text-decoration: underline">CV</a> for a lengthier and more formal documentation of my skills and professional journey.</p>

            <h3>Lemma</h3>
            <p>Lemma is a scalable, single-page JavaScript application for natural-language processing built in the Angular framework. It measures cosine similarity between the tf-idf vectors of a query and a control set of data. Because it incorporates Browserify, it can use all the algorithms of the "Natural" node module. Nonetheless, I coded Lemma's tf-idf algorithm myself because I wanted to know more about its strengths and weaknesses. Lemma is my first step in testing a theory I have about the use of digital tools to quantify qualitative human phenomena.</p>
